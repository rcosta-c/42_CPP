# C++ Modules Collection @ 42Porto
C++ Modules is a comprehensive project series developed at 42 Porto as part of the Object-Oriented Programming curriculum. This collection spans ten modules (CPP 00-09) that progressively introduce fundamental and advanced concepts of C++ programming, from basic syntax and classes to advanced features like templates, STL containers, and algorithmic problem-solving. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation in modern C++ development practices.

# üìå Project Objectives

Master the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming through practical implementation of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Explore advanced C++ features including templates, STL containers, and iterators to write efficient and reusable code.
Develop proficiency in memory management, exception handling, and the principles of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
Apply algorithmic thinking through container manipulation and custom algorithm implementation.
Build a comprehensive understanding of C++ syntax, from basic input/output to complex template metaprogramming.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: C++98
Paradigms: Object-Oriented Programming, Generic Programming
Concepts: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Templates, STL
Memory Management: Stack vs Heap allocation, Smart pointers concepts, RAII principles
Tools: Makefile compilation, debugging techniques, coding standards compliance

# üìö Module Breakdown
CPP 00-01: Introduction to C++ syntax, classes, and basic OOP concepts

CPP 02-03: Operator overloading, canonical form, and inheritance principles
CPP 04: Polymorphism, abstract classes, and interface implementation
CPP 05-06: Exception handling, form validation, and advanced class design
CPP 07: Function templates and template specialization
CPP 08: STL containers, iterators, and algorithmic problem-solving
CPP 09: Advanced STL usage with practical applications including Bitcoin Exchange rate calculator, Reverse Polish Notation evaluator, and Ford-Johnson merge-insert sorting algorithm implementation

# üîç Challenges Faced
Transitioning from C to C++ required adapting to new paradigms, particularly understanding when to use classes versus procedural approaches. Working with templates presented compilation challenges, while memory management introduced RAII concepts and proper constructor/destructor design. The STL modules demanded understanding container characteristics and iterator validity, and exception handling required balancing safety with performance. The final module brought practical challenges: CSV parsing for Bitcoin exchange rates, implementing stack-based calculations, and optimizing the Ford-Johnson sorting algorithm with performance comparisons between different STL containers. Each module progressively built complexity, creating a solid foundation for advanced C++ development.
